# cafe-game
This is a cozy cafe game where you play as Pandy, who is operating his cafe and hoping to grow his business by making money and making his customers happy. Play the most recent release of the game [here](https://rebeccacw.itch.io/pandys-parlour).

## controls
* **space bar** switches between fixed camera viewing the cafe and Pandy's pov
* **mouse** Use your mouse to move customers. Click a customer, then drag and drop them to seat them somewhere in the cafe.
* **Q** Press q to interact with objects in the scene. To interact with objects, you must be standing close to the thing you wish to interact with. You can interact with customers (to serve them food/drinks), the pastry case, the coffee machine, and the trash can.

## how to increase customer satisfaction
Customers want their orders served to them in a timely fashion. If you keep them waiting too long, they'll get impatient and become less satisfied. Don't leave them waiting too long, or they'll exit the cafe entirely :(
